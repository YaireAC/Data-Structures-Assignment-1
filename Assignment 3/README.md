# Data-Structures-Assignment-23
This is a program for the course Data Structures at Oregon State. This assignment was intended to have us explore non-linear data structures by implementing a binary search tree (BST). After mplementing the BST, we solved some BST-based puzzle problems. 


## The program completes the following requirements.

### <ins>BST Functionalities </ins>
- `bst_create()` correctly allocates and initializes a BST
- `bst_free()` correctly frees the memory allocated to a BST with no memory leaks
- `bst_size()` correctly determines the number of elements in a BST
- `bst_insert()` correctly inserts a key/value pair into a BST, maintaining the BST property with respect to all keys in the tree
- `bst_remove()` correctly removes a key/value pair from a BST based on a specified key, maintaining the BST property with respect to all keys in the tree
- `bst_get()` correctly retrieves the value associated with a given key in a BST

### <ins>BST "puzzles"</ins>
- `bst_height()` correctly computes the height of a BST
- `bst_path_sum()` correctly validates a path sum in a BST

### Limitations of the program
- 1 wrong key/value at the last part of the test
- Did not implement `best_range_path`
